# Credits
Credits to Andrew Hamel whom made it possible for us to use and modify the original project.
The remanescent files from the original project are the files contained in the .vscode folder aswell as the MakeFile on the root. Otherwise the project would have been hard to make it work properly

# raylib-Bomberman
This project was modified by the following UFRGS alumni: Matheus Fracaro Tonera, id 00594878 and Eduardo Nunes for its use on a presentation on the final project at the class "Algoritmos e Programação". The projects consists in replicating from scratch a "mini-bomberman" provided by the teacher in class and modifiying it.

## To Build
GitHub doesn't allow empty folders in repositories, so you'll need to create an "obj" folder in the root of the repository before trying to build! After that you have to open the repo's folder in VSCode and simply press F5, to build and execute. Double check the path variables in the Makefile to make sure they point to Raylib on your machine if the linker fails. You can also invoke `make` from the root of the project to build.

# The game
Custom Mini Bomberman made from "scratch" with some modifications.
